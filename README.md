Pixel-aligned feed-forward 3DGS methods suffer from two primary limitations: 1) 2D feature matching struggles to effectively resolve the multi-view alignment problem, and 2) the Gaussian density is constrained and cannot be adaptively controlled according to scene complexity. We propose VolSplat, a method that directly regresses Gaussians from 3D features based on a voxel-aligned prediction strategy. This approach achieves adaptive control over scene complexity and resolves the multi-view alignment challenge.

<strong>Overview of VolSplat</strong>. Given multi-view images as input, we first extract 2D features for each image using a Transformer-based network and construct per-view cost volumes with plane sweeping. Depth Prediction Module then estimates a depth map for each view, which is used to unproject the 2D features into 3D space to form a voxel feature grid. Subsequently, we employ a sparse 3D decoder to refine these features in 3D space and predict the parameters of a 3D Gaussian for each occupied voxel. Finally, novel views are rendered from the predicted 3D Gaussians.
